# 🚀 YOLOv8 Object Detection on Video 🎥

This repository contains a Python script that utilizes the **YOLOv8** model for object detection in a video. The detected objects are highlighted with bounding boxes 🟩, and the processed video is saved as an **MP4** file. 📁

---

## ✨ Why is this important?

Object detection is a crucial technology used in **autonomous vehicles 🚗, surveillance systems 🛡️, traffic monitoring 🚦, and more**. With **YOLOv8**, we achieve high accuracy and real-time processing, making AI-powered vision applications more accessible and efficient! 💡

---

## 🔥 Features

✅ Uses **Ultralytics YOLOv8** for advanced object detection.
✅ Processes an input video and detects objects **frame by frame** 🎞️.
✅ Saves the output video with bounding boxes and **vehicle count** 🚗.
✅ Supports **GPU acceleration** for **faster processing** ⚡.

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python torch numpy
```

---

## 🎯 Usage

1️⃣ Place your video file in the project directory. 📂
2️⃣ Update the script to reference your video file:
   ```python
   video_path = "path/to/your/video.mp4"
   ```
3️⃣ Run the script with:
   ```bash
   python object_detection.py
   ```

✅ Ensure that your input video file is available in the specified path.

---

## 📤 Output

🎥 The processed video will be saved as **output.mp4** in the project directory. 🏁

---

## 📎 Attaching Video File

To upload your video file to **GitHub**:
1️⃣ Place the video file in the repository folder.
2️⃣ Commit and push the file using the following commands:
   ```bash
